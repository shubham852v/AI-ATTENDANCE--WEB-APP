## About The Project

Provide a brief introduction to your project here. What is "MY-ATTENDANCE-APP"? What problem does it solve?
For example:

"MY-ATTENDANCE-APP is a modern web application designed to simplify and automate the process of tracking attendance. Utilizing cutting-edge technologies like React for a dynamic user interface, Firebase for robust backend services (authentication, database), and a vision AI for accurate face recognition, this application aims to provide an efficient and insightful attendance management solution for individuals or small organizations."

---

## Features

List the key features of your application.

* **User Authentication:** Secure login and registration using Firebase.
* **Webcam Attendance Capture:** Capture live images for attendance marking.
* **Face Recognition/Verification:** (Potentially using Gemini API or similar) to identify users.
* **Attendance Logging:** Record attendance with timestamps.
* **Attendance History:** View past attendance records.
* **Responsive Design:** Optimized for various screen sizes.
* **(Add more as your project develops, e.g., Admin Dashboard, Reporting, etc.)**

---

## Getting Started

This section will guide you through setting up the project locally.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (LTS version recommended)
* [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/my-attendance-app.git](https://github.com/your-username/my-attendance-app.git)
    cd my-attendance-app
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # OR
    yarn install
    ```
3.  **Firebase Configuration:**
    * Create a new project in the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
    * Add a web app to your Firebase project.
    * Copy your Firebase configuration object.
    * Create a file named `.env.local` in the root of your project and add your Firebase credentials like this:

        ```dotenv
        VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY
        VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN
        VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=YOUR_PROJECT_ID
        VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=YOUR_STORAGE_BUCKET
        VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=YOUR_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID
        VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=YOUR_APP_ID
        VITE_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=YOUR_MEASUREMENT_ID
        ```
    * (Optional) **Gemini API Configuration:** If you're using the Gemini API for face recognition, you'll also need to set up its credentials. Add them to your `.env.local` file:
        ```dotenv
        VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY=YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY
        ```

4.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # OR
    yarn dev
    ```
    The application will typically be accessible at `http://localhost:5173/` (or another port if 5173 is in use).
